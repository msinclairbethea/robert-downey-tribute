    <p><b>Robert Downey Jr.</b> has evolved into one of the most respected actors in Hollywood. With an amazing list of credits to his name, he has managed to stay new and fresh even after over four decades in the business.</p>
    
    <h3>Early Life</h3>
    
    <p><b>Robert Downey Jr.</b> was born on April 4, 1965, in New York City. He is the son of the avant-garde filmmaker <b>Robert Downey Sr.</b>, who is best known for the 1969 film <i><b>Putney Swope</b></i>. Downey began acting as a young child. His mother, Elsie, was an actress who instilled in her son a love of performing. Raised in Greenwich Village with his older sister, Alison, Downey made his film debut playing a puppy in his father's film, Pound (1970), in which actors played dogs. He would go on to have small parts in several more of his father's films.</p>
    <h3>Drug Addiction & Arrest</h3>
    <p> Robert was introduced to drugs at the age of eight by his father, and developed a full-fledged addiction as he headed into his 20s. He continued starring in films even as his struggle with alcohol and drug use began to take hold of his life off the set. He was able to stay sober while working on a film for a period of time, but would soon fall off the wagon and begin using again. The actor's drug-related problems escalated from 1996 to 2001, and was arrested numerous times on charges related to drugs including <strong>heroin</strong>, <strong>cocaine</strong>, <strong>marijuana</strong>.
